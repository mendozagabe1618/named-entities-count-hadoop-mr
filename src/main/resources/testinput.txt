Hugo,



FYI, Rick Marshall unofficially approved a 3-day trip for one person from the Enterprise team down to Jacksonville, FL to assist in the catalog reinstall.



I’ll be placing it in the travel portal soon for the official process, so that the option becomes officially available to us.



I think together we’ll be able to push through the environment differences better in person than over the phone.



Let us know whether your site can even accommodate a visitor, and when you’d like to exercise this option.



Respectfully,



Amir Soofi



Principal Software Engineer, Enterprise
